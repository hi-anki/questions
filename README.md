- Can learning be hyper-scaled? Can the total time taken be fixed, irrespective of the subject, topic, or entire domain itself?
- Can learning be made an O(1) process?
- Is learning an independent process or an integrated process?
  - The two things that matter here are:
    1. The learning process itself, and
    2. The subject being learned.
  - If the ability to learn is all that matters, than complexity is definitely just a state of mind. And improving my ability to learn will make learning easier and the total time taken would be reduced.
  - If the subject is what that matters, then there are two possibilitie:
    - Learning all things related to web development will make me good in it. And I would become more sound to the technological advancements happening in the space.
    - But once I shift from web development to low-level development, like compilers and OS, the space is completely different, and it is almost similar to starting from scratch. And with such thinking, there is no way learning can be made an 0(1) process!
   
  - But my current understanding says that it is an integrated process, where both the factors matter. The ratio is unknown to me and maybe it differs person-to-person as well.
    - I think so because of **transferrable skills**.
    - Web development teaches programming and that is transferrable to compiler development as well. So, I am not completely starting from scratch in that sense.
    - But this gives rise to another problem, umbrella-things.
    - Compiler development and web development, both fall under programming and computer science. That's why the transferrable skill helped. This suggests that transferrable skills also transfer under the same umbrella only?
    - How would programming help me if I go about learning guitar? One can say, now you are programming guitar. The foundational things like spotting problems in you learning methodology would help you. But that's about learning itself. Not about transferrable skills.
    - If programming helped me in spotting subtle problems, then it is enhancement in the overall learning methodology itself. And in that way, only what gets repeated gets embedded in the learning methodology and once it is integrated in the learning methodology and becomes my second nature, it is no longer an umbrella-thing. It can be applied everywhere, and that's a truly transferrable skill.
    - If I jumped on an enitrely different craft, say sketching. What would be my state then? How can programming help me there?
    - You may say color theory and UI/UX designing might help me in drawing.
    - What if I was a backend developer? What if I have nothing to do with UIs? And my onlyl concern is logic? Say I was a compiler developer, using vim and other terminal tool-chain as my daily driver. Black bg and white characters on top.
    - Saying "learning would develop my instincts" is a better way to hide the complexity of this topic. Because you can't dissect instincts. It is saying that "I know there exists something that helps but I don't know what that is". It can't be articulated.

  - Concept absorption, practice and iteration, pattern recognition, and adaptation; this is the crux of learning at a high-level. All of these take their time.
    - Making learning itself an 0(1) process is a far-away thing. But that doesn't mean I can't do anything.
    - Learning methodology and time taken follows an inverse relationship. The efficient my learning process is, the less time it would take me to learn something. Thus, optimising my learning methodology is possibly the best I can do to reduce time taken.
    - The subject of learning also follows the same inverse relationship, but it has some nuances.
      - When the umbrella is same, previous learning experiences in that umbrella helps.
      - On the other hand, if the subject falls under a different umbrella, and I have no experience, it is as good as starting from scratch. But the learning methodology I would have formed so far would help me.
    - In that sense, it can be said that learning methodology provides level 1 scaling. While previous dataset provides level 2 scaling.
    - Learning methodology is independent of umbrella, while existing dataset of experiences and understanding is dependent on the umbrella they belong to.
    - If the new thing falls under the same umbrella, I can take advantage of both L1 and L2 scaling.
    - If the new thing falls under a different umbrella, I can only take advantage of L1 scaling. But, if I have previous experiences in that umbrella, I can also take advantage of L2 scaling.
    - And yes, the amount and quality of L1 scaling depends on the enhancements done in the learning methodology, while the amount and quality of L2 scaling depends on the availability of existing dataset, where the quality of dataset matters as equal as the quantity.
    - It can be said that L1 is the base and L2 very much builds upon it. While L1 also improves via L2.
   
  - But there is a problem to this. **External Factors**
    - The whole idea we have discused so far is just like an *ideal gas equation*. Good for solving questions but, in reality, its complex.
    - So far, we discused what we can control. This is about what we can't.
    - Up to a point, external factors are just internal problems masked as external factors to avoid taking credit of our own incapabilities.
    - But after a point, it just boil down to purely external factors only. Though I have to test the ending part, whether it is about external factors at the end or my own mental interpretation of them . But yeah.
    - The problem is, as long as there are external factors, influencing the inner state, there is always going to be a delta. There is always going to be difference b/w what I thought I would achieve and what I actually achieved.
    - Because I can never map the reality in such a situation. When it is all about internal factor, I can fine tune it as far as possible. But when external factors, most importantly, things out of my control, are involved, and in such a way that they become the 20% thing that influences the 80%, that's when the problem has become significant. And that's precisely the idea I am testing right now. And I'll conclude it soon.
  - Stop here. Lets build L1 and L2 scaling. Someday in future, we'll talk about sorting out this **external factors** problem.
