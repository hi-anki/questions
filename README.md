Can learning be hyper-scaled? Can the total time taken be fixed, irrespective of the subject, topic, or entire domain itself?
Can learning be made an O(1) process?
Is learning an independent process or an integrated process?
  - The two things that matter here are:
    1. The learning process itself, and
    2. The subject being learned.
  - If the ability to learn is all that matters, than complexity is definitely just a state of mind. And improving my ability to learn will make learning easier and the total time taken would be reduced.
  - If the subject is what that matters, then there are two possibilitie:
    - Learning all things related to web development will make me good in it. And I would become more sound to the technological advancements happening in the space.
    - But once I shift from web development to low-level development, like compilers and OS, the space is completely different, and it is almost similar to starting from scratch. And with such thinking, there is no way learning can be made an 0(1) process!
   
  - But my current understanding says that it is an integrated process, where both the factors matter. The ratio is unknown to me and maybe it differs person-to-person as well.
    - I think so because of **transferrable skills**.
    - Web development teaches programming and that is transferrable to compiler development as well. So, I am not completely starting from scratch in that sense.
    - But this gives rise to another problem, umbrella-things.
    - Compiler development and web development, both fall under programming and computer science. That's why the transferrable skill helped. This suggests that transferrable skills also transfer under the same umbrella only?
    - How would programming help me if I go about learning guitar? One can say, now you are programming guitar. The foundational things like spotting problems in you learning methodology would help you. But that's about learning itself. Not about transferrable skills.
    - If programming helped me in spotting subtle problems, then it is enhancement in the overall learning methodology itself. And in that way, only what gets repeated gets embedded in the learning methodology and once it is integrated in the learning methodology and becomes my second nature, it is no longer an umbrella-thing. It can be applied everywhere, and that's a truly transferrable skill.
    - If I jumped on an enitrely different craft, say sketching. What would be my state then? How can programming help me there?
    - You may say color theory and UI/UX designing might help me in drawing.
    - What if I was a backend developer? What if I have nothing to do with UIs? And my onlyl concern is logic? Say I was a compiler developer, using vim and other terminal tool-chain as my daily driver. Black bg and white characters on top.
    - Saying "learning would develop my instincts" is a better way to hide the complexity of this topic. Because you can't dissect instincts. It is saying that "I know there exists something that helps but I don't know what that is". It can't be articulated.
